=== Calendar ===

Contributor: Valerie Lamm


Project Purpose: 

I keep track of my daily activities and wanted it to be in my own personally styled digital calendar. 

I initially filled this in manually, filling in the day and data for each day. Now I only have to separate it by months. The javascript file targets each month, parses the hidden data, creates new elements, adds the dates, adds the data, and ultimately fills in the calendar for me.

Initial Creation Date: Jan 3, 2020
